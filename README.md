# PyCAMELOT: Python Code and Module Essentials for Library Organization and Templating

Welcome to PyCAMELOT, a comprehensive framework designed to streamline the setup and organization of Python projects. Embodying the spirit of Camelot's legendary knights, PyCAMELOT equips Python developers with the tools and structure necessary for coding excellence and efficiency.

## Project Structure
- `assets/`: Directory for project assets. [Learn More](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages)
- `data/`: Directory for data files. [Best Practices](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/)
- `modules/`: Python modules for utilities and classes. [Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
- `main.py`: Main Python script for the project. [Python Scripts](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/)

## Setup Scripts
- `setup.bat`: Windows script for setting up the environment. [Windows Python Setup](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html)
- `setup.sh`: Linux script for setting up the environment. [Linux Python Setup](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html)

## Usage
Run the setup script appropriate for your system. It creates a virtual environment and sets up the project structure. [Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

## Core Modules
- `utils.py`: Utility functions like path handling and logging setup. [Logging in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)
- `classes.py`: Example classes with basic methods. [Python Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)

## Testing and Quality Assurance
Maintain high code standards with tests in the `tests/` directory. [Python Testing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
